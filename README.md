# SilentAssistant
[In Progress] Cognitive assistant for Windows Desktop that responds to voice and facial poses.

GOAL: User will have an agent that responds to their voice without having to prompt its attention as one traditionally does with "Hey Siri" or "Hey Alexa". This agent will use the user's facial pose (looking at screen vs looking away) to detect when it should listen, and then if the user's attention is detected it will execute verbal commands such as "Open Chrome" or "Send an email".

Currently blocked by the lack of accessbile ML frameworks in C#. Paused until Smoke.net is developed.
